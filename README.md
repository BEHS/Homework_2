# Homework 2

**Description:** To identify the circular towns I used as reference the “geometric manipulations” [page](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide/geometric_manipulations.html) from the GeoPandas website (https://geopandas.org) and Google Gemini to calculate the *circularity ratio* (e.g., as described in [Shekar & Mathew, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S258947142300030X)), and then filter towns for circularity. I used different thresholds of circularity for each State since some of them had too many circular cities like in Georgia and South Carolina, in contrast to Florida and Tennessee which generally had less circular cities.
